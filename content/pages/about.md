I love Apache projects. I have used a number of them in the past and I am still using many, because they cover a wide gamut of applications, are well designed and (mostly) well documented, and are backed by a large community of contributors and users. There is a lot to be learned from the Apache Software Foundation, both in terms of software and in terms of management.

In the last few months I have found myself visiting the [list of projects](https://projects.apache.org) more and more times just to see "what's up", opening new projects' pages and trying to figure out if they could be useful for my work or interesting to tinker with. I started reading and creating examples, and I realized that I would soon forget about them if I didn't write them up in an easily reproducible way.

Inspired by the [Python Module of the Week](https://pymotw.com) blog, and with the desire to give back to the Apache community not only with code, I decided to open this blog. My aim is to (try and) write about at least a project per month, starting from projects that are new to me, to share what I learn as I create (and work my way through) usable examples. Since each project has its own degree of complexity, I expect each article to be pretty different from every other. Feedback and suggestions are always very welcome.
