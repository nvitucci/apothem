#### What kind of projects will be covered?

I am very much into data, so the projects I am mostly inclined towards fall into this category. That said, I am attracted by interesting and novel approaches in general... and by cool names as well!

#### Why "Apothem"?

Besides being a great acronym for "Apache project(s) of the month", I like the idea and metaphor of an [apothem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothem) as the shortest straight path from knowing just about the project's summary (the _center_) to understanding the central idea of each of the projects' aspects (the _midpoints_).

#### Why the hexagon?

Because it's a cool shape! It is also [quite common](https://interestingengineering.com/why-is-the-hexagon-everywhere-all-about-this-seemingly-common-shape) and [nature seems to like it](http://nautil.us/issue/35/boundaries/why-nature-prefers-hexagons).

#### Why Pelican?

I was looking for a static site generator with the following requirements:

* easily deployed to Github Pages;
* written in Python;
* using the Jinja templating system;
* with pluggable and easily customizable themes;
* supporting Markdown content;
* with syntax highlighting.

[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) had all the features I needed and I could start with it straight away. I am aware of alternatives such as [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) (which I have used in the past) and [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/), and I might be trying some of them in the future.
